# SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT NFTs - README

## Overview

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows brands and users to register and add sustainable products to the Ethereum blockchain. The product details are stored as NFTs on IPFS, and each product is associated with a QR code that consumers can scan to verify its authenticity and sustainability claims. This ensures transparency, trust, and verifiability of product information.

## Key Features
- **Add Sustainable Products**: Users can register products on the blockchain, which are stored as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
- **QR Code Generation**: Each product is associated with a unique QR code that consumers can scan to view the product details on the blockchain.
- **Blockchain-based Storage**: Product data is stored in a decentralized manner using IPFS and Ethereum, ensuring tamper-proof and verifiable records.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet for secure account management and interaction with the platform.

## Tech Stack
- **Smart Contracts (Solidity)**: Ethereum smart contracts handle product registration, verification, and NFT minting.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **Frontend (React.js)**: A React-based user interface for product management and QR code interactions.
- **IPFS**: Used for decentralized storage of product data.
